# Overview

Currently working on my Case Study project about bicycle data to find out how we can influence casual riders to become annual memberships for company growth. Stakeholders, Lily Moreno whom is over our marketing department & the executive team of approval are  wanting to know three questions?
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 

- How can Clyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
